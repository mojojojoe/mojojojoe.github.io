# My Friend Poe

Once upon a night, 
I walked a path in fright,
where along the Edge I dwelt
with my friend Poe,
the dislikened Angel.

I remembered him from the hinterland.
And a dismembered timbrel in me felt 
the joy 
of his broken wing, 
hagged beak, 
and miren claw.

Poe, overcome by so much, flew.
In secret, he was wrought,
and in the dark was worded.

On the day when his love was slain,
and in the rain he was boarded,
he found words, and seizing them,
he stretched to be distorted.

He rose to seize the pain,
that he carried,
but he faced the way of perennial sway,
and always be harried.
