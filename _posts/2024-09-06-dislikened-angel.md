# The Dislikened Angel

Once upon a night,
I walked in fright.
Where on the Edge I dwelt
with the dislikened Angel.

I remembered him from the hinterland.
And a dismembered timbrel in me felt 
the joy 
of his broken wing, 
hagged beak, 
and miren claw.

Overcome, he flew.
But in secret, was wrought,
and in the dark he was worded.
On the day when his love was slain,
he was boarded.

But he found the words and seizing them,
He stretched to be distorted.
He seized the pain that he carried, 
and went to a day of continual play.

He forever took the part.
