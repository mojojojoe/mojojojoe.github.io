Robert Shiller's forthright novel, “The New Financial Order: Risk in the 21st Century” expounds on financial innovation in the 21st Century. Due to rapid developments in digital innovation, especially as a result of the pandemic, I thought it would be interesting to compare Shiller’s ideas of two decades ago with present developments in financial innovation.

Shiller's ideas included the following:

    Insurance for livelihood and home value
    Big risk trades in a macro market
    Income linked loans
    Inequality insurance
    Inter-generational social security
    International risk control agreements

To achieve these ends, Shiller proposed a global risk identification database (GRID) and new units of measurement and electronic money. Shiller's approach to risk management problems seems very top down. He considers macroscopic economic problems and his solutions, individual-based in a global risk identification database, and transaction-based through electronic currency and new measurements, speak of a central planner.

Currently, financial innovation is focused on:

    Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, which has emerged, most popularly, as an anonymous mechanism and unit of exchange. Built on block chain technology, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) allow individuals to reassert ownership of their creations and to sell them on without risk of fraud or counterfeiting.
    Micro-insurance, which is emerging as a mechanism to insure the poor and is enabled by micro payment and fintech technology.
    Banking is being upturned as machine learning and data mining technology are adopted or taken up to provide individualised services.
    Digital recognition software has made rapid advances, but this has almost become socially unacceptable in the modern world. This is because the technology can be adopted by those with sinister intentions, but it also has positive uses.

However, the mechanism most useful to the modern financial institution is the digital trail linked to an individual. I would say that the biggest asset in the modern digital age is information.

Information can be mined and monetized. It can be used in ominous ways to manipulate or coerce people. But it can also be used to mitigate the risks that individuals face by identifying novel risks and quantifying known risks. New financial products can emerge to benefit from the identification of risk.

The rate at which financial innovation is advancing, Schiller will soon have to write a new book, perhaps one that he could convert into a non-fungible token!
