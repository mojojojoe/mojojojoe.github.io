*The token as a digital asset*


Strange as it seems, I don't think nonfungible tokens have much to do
with mushrooms. But, given a very silky road, perhaps the fungible token
was better meant to be used with this produce.

What are these fungible and nonfungible things? And what are tokens?

Margaret Raden, a legal scholar of property theory differentiated the
first two of these ideas in her research.

She described the fungible 'thing' as anything that could willy nilly be
replaced, like, you guessed it a coin, or a brick.

Nonfungible things are irreplaceable. They are very personal in that
sense, because the most irreplaceable 'thing' we have is ourselves. From
the admiration they cause, artwork might also be irreplaceable. But so
too is real estate property, because each property is unique in the
universe.

While I have drawn your attention to the fungible and the nonfungible
what does it mean to be a tokenized? This is the most important idea of
this article, because a digital token is a code which represents the
holder's rights.

Tokens identifiers can *represent* anything in Ethereum, the open source
project holding a group of technologies that rose up beside bitcoin. But
that doesn't really explain them.

Perhaps it is better to say that the process of minting currency tokens
across the industry led to a basical technical standard for these
tokens. They all shared traits, and it was with these traits in mind
that Ethereum created a standard that others could use to create their
own fungible tokens. This standard is called ERC20.

ERC20 stipulates that the point of tokens is

• to be able to transfer them from one account to another
• to get the account balance of tokens
• to get the total supply of tokens on the network
• to approve whether an token from an account can be spent by a third
  party account.

As blockchain innovations developed, the token was extended from just
the humble fungible token to the nonfungible token.

Another standard was suggested in 2018 called ERC721 which lays out a
template for nonfungible tokens, where each token is unique.

ERC721 is more complex than ERC20. It has many optional extensions and
it is split across a number of contracts. OpenZeppelin contracts give
flexibility to combine them.

Once again ERC72 implementations give this functionality:

• to be able to transfer tokens between accounts
• to get the current token balance of an account
• to get the owner of a specific token
• to get the total supply of the token available on the network
• functionality to approve an amount of token can be moved by a third
  party account

Additionally, an ERC72 NFT Contract is a smart contract that implements
a given set of methods and events which when deployed are responsible
for keeping track of tokens on Ethereum.

For the ERC721 NFT contract to interact with the ERC721 token a contract
application binary interface (ABI) is needed

It is not just fungible and nonfungible tokens that exist. There are
others out there.

There are utility tokens, tokenized securities, asset backed tokens, and
reward tokens.
