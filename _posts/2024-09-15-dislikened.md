# The Dislikened

| Once upon a night,
| I walked a path of fright.
| Where on the Edge I dwelt
| with the dislikened angel.
| 
| I remembered him from the hinterland.
| And a dismembered timbrel in me
| felt the joy of his broken wing,
| hagged beak, and miren claw.
| 
| Overcome, he flew.
| But in secret, was wrought,
| and in the dark he was
| worded. On the day when
| his love was slain,
| he was boarded.
| 
| He found the words and seizing them,
| He stretched to be distorted.
| He seized the pain,
| but continued to be contorted.
| Forever taking the part.
