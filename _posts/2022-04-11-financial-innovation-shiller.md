Robert Shiller's forthright novel "The new financial order" expounds on financial innovation in the 21st Century. It could be interesting to compare Shillers ideas of two decades ago with the present developments in financial innovation.

What were Shiller's ideas?

1. Insurance for livelihood and home value.
2. Big risk trades in a macro market.
3. Income linked loans.
4. Inequality insurance.
5. Intergenerational social security.
6. International risk control agreements.

To achieve these ends, Shiller proposed a global risk identification database (GRID) and new units of measurement and electronic money.

Shiller's approach to the risk management problems seem very top down. He considers macroscopic economic problems and his solutions, individual based in a global risk identification database and transaction based through electronic currency and new measurments speak of a central planner.

What is happening in the sphere of financial innovation presently?

Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has emerged, most popularly as an anonymous mechanism and unit of exchange.

Built on block chain technology, non fungiable tokens (NFT) allow individuals to reassert ownership of their creations and to sell on without risk of fraud or counterfeiting.

Micro-insurance is emerging as a mechanism to insure the poor and is enabled by micro payment and fintech technology.

Banking is being upturned as machine learning and data mining technology is adopted or taken up to provide individualised services.

Digital recognition has become socially unacceptable in the polite world. However, the technology has become adopted by repressive regimes to make their populations comply with social norms issued by edict from politicians and rulers.

However, the mechanism most useful to the modern financial institution is the digital trail linked to an individual.

The biggest asset in the modern digital age is information.

Information can be mined and monetized. It can be used to manipulate people or to coerce them. But it can also be used to mitigate the risks that individuals face by identifying novel risks and quantifying known risks. New financial products can emerge to benefit from the identification of risk.
