# Ideas on the future of Southern Africa

In my geopolitical analysis of the South African situation I come to a conclusion that the only way to turn around and grow the region's prosperity, is for Southern Africa to become a self-sufficient system.

In other words, Southern Africa needs to disengage from the rest of the world, particularly from the "Allied" West, as the global financial system -- by its design -- is made to extract the marrow out of the world.

I would argue that this is the real reason that the transition from Apartheid was enabled. The Boers had grown too self-sufficient, and they were about to achieve the final move in their drive to self-suffiency. The conquest of Angola.

Angola has a very special status. It is the only country in Africa to be able to be self-sufficient. The Boer mantra that they were defending the free West against communist takeover was disengenious. The analysts knew better.

So, as a quick diversion from the topic, who did the enabling for Apartheid to be dismantled? Well, while Margaret Thatcher was loudly bemoaning the state of the UKs response to the South African question, the UK was quietly at information war, and later economic war, against South Africa, which eventually forced change.

The vocal anti-Apartheid movement were at the fore. But the government funded BBC was perhaps the most vociferous in highlighting and exaggerating the Boer question. What will my compatriots say about this, particularly victims of Apartheid?

My answer is that the Boer way of thinking is very African, and I would argue that the liberal ideas held by the ANC were actually not very African and were more modern British in their approach. At that stage of their history, the British were very much into inclusivity and mingling. Perhaps an abberation, as they seem to be leaving that mindset to go back to their original default racist/tribalist approach.

But what about the inequality, and the suffering at the hands of the Boers? There is always this problem when at war. But why were we at war with our own people. Why were the Boers at a point where they didn't want blacks to be partners in governance. This exclusion, which is what South Africa was, was a construction of the British. South Africa was very much a British entity.

When Verwoerd announced independence, the British instigated their quiet war. And that, ultimately, has destroyed our country, as we have undergone more destruction, over 30 years, and even to a greater extent, than Germany underwent in World War II.

But what is the root cause. What was Britain's reason? I believe it is that they couldn't tolerate the emergence of a Southern African superstate. And South Africa came arduously close to reaching that when they were ready to take Angola.

Could it be possible that agents in government argued for us to hold back on our invasion of Angola, thus scuppering the idea of a super state, and paving the way to South Africa's impoverishment.

Presently, the world is at a crossroads in its history. 

The Americans have withdrawn from global policing. Globalism is ending. China is collapsing, so too is Russia. Germany is deindustrialising. The UK and France are global peripheries. But South Africa will become a back water, because it is deeply intertwined with globalism. It is not self-sufficient. And the possibilities are limited.

The rich nations use the US dollar as their /de facto/ currency, giving the US inordinate power and this will draw in the globe's capital for decades to come as the elderly nations, forced to keep their interest rates low, send their capital to the US to achieve an acceptable growth rate. Trillions will flow to the US and the world's marrow will further be consumed by a gluttonous America.
