The extraordinary innovation taking place in the blockchain sphere brings fundamental change to an individual's ability to own and profit from digital and intellectual property through nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and the smart contract.

NFTs come in 3 categories:

- 
  
(What sort of incantations do you get of nonfungible tokens? and the smart contract?)

It may be interesting to learn a bit about property theory and the role property law plays in owning something. Similarly it may be worthwhile learning more about contract law.

In order to determine which assets are appropriate subject matters of property
law, (as opposed to contract law) one can simply pose the question: would the taking of the physical embodiment of the asset substantially deprive the holder of the value?

If the answer is yes, then the asset should receive *in rem* protection
and consequently be considered property. 

Consider the purchase of a nonfungible token with a music track attached. The token is unique and consequently the music track represents a unique copy of the template track. If taken, the owner will lose the value of purchase costs and potential profit of sale income. Further he will lose the right of enjoyment*gain of the artwork purchased. In my opinion his NFT is therefore his property and should be conferred *in rem* protection.

The smart contract attached to the NFT acts to enforce value transfer to the owner of the template original and holder of copyright of the music art at the turn of each transaction to do with the NFT in question.

Hence associated with any NFT there are two owners. The owner of the copy and the owner of the original. The owner of the copy is conferred *in rem* rights to profit and benefit from the purchase of the copy but the owner of the template original has *in personam* rights too.

(what are examples of *in personam* rights?)

* A new theory of propery

In their 2005 paper "A Theory of Property" Bell and Parchovomsky (B&M) presented a unified conceptual framework with a consistent definition of property.

Their property theory was built on the insight that the law is organized to create and defend the *value of stable ownership*.

Property law should help create stable relationsihps between persons and assets, thereby *allowing owners to gain value otherwise unavailable*.

B&M believed that all property law should be analysed through the value prism.

Locke, Marx and many others presented a value component in their writings as well as more recently in the writings of Radin and Barzel.

However B&M break away from this prior use of value and depart from current conceptualist thinking.

Locke and Marx both viewed value as the connecting link between labour and ownership. Labour enhances the value of things, so that the labourer should be entitled to the value added component.

Locke used this notion to justify a natural right basis of ownership. Marx used it to justify empowerment of working people.

Radin divided the world into fungible and personal (nonfungible) things. Nonfungible things have a special value for their owner whereas fungible things lack uniqueness. Radin proposed restricting property rule protection only to cases only involving nonfungible things and offer only compensation protection to all other cases. With Radin, owners only had idiosyncratic value in their fungible things.

M&B shed new light on Radin's work. Radin's distinction between personal and fungible property leads to the gap between reserve and market prices. This is due to sentiment from Radin's "self-constitution". When a woman loses her wedding ring the loss is painful and cannot be relieved through replacement. In this case of sentiment, the value cannot be measured in market price. In this case the resere price will exceed the market price that someone else will pay.

There are other elements too, other than sentiment. For instance skill, which will allow an owner to extract greater utility from a commercial asset.

The value theory of B&M, with emphasis placed on value of stable ownership implies greater protection for people who derive unique value from their assets. The conferral of status and enforcement will protect this value and facilitate the creation of such value by enabling the owners to develop value enhancing expectations and patters of behaviour.

Barzel placed value at the centre of property. The ability to derive value from an asset constituted an economic property right. Law recognizes or fails to recognize this. Barzel viewed contracts as the legal institution for extracting value. Property is a mere background for exchange.

However failed to see that the law's recognition and protection of property rights *creates* alue for owners. The stability of ownership created by the law creates new value in and uses of property that is otherwise unavailable.

Legal property should be at the centre of property analysis rather than an aside. M&Bs value thoery views the owner as the primary beneficiary of value, while others may benefit from positive externalities(?). The owner does not only obtain legal protection but also gets to decide how much the property is developed and how much to invest in self help. Hence the owner decides how much value to leave to others and the ease with which they can captur it.


--------------------------------------------------


To B&M, value theory emphasised rights in property law. 

Under the value theory, *in rem* rights (the rights of the thing) are a creative force and *in rem* protection establishes the chance of maintaining value in stability and by sentiment.

For example, a business in the Holy Land decides to scoop air into sealed cans.  The sealed cans are exported and sold, if held close to face when opened, as whiffs of the air Jesus breathed.

Now *in rem* rights are needed to defend the value of the cans of air (as opposed to just *in personam* rights). If the cans never had *in rem* rights it is doubtful the cans could leave the shop never mind be exported, as the owner would have to enter a contract of transfer with anyone wanting to breath the air from the tins he owned.

In a world without *in rem* rights, someone would have to have a contract with every potential transferee, whether consensual or not, to create a legal *in personam* means of transferring possession. The result would be that only a few people could enjoy stable possession rights.

This has changed with NFTs on blockchains. Now everybody can enjoy *in personam* rights on digital assets through smart contracts. (?)

We can see that *in rem* rights are a mechanism to protect the value held in stable ownership of assets and give legal protection for asset value that any holder may enjoy. These rights are indespensable for realizing the full potential of an asset.

*Radin's nonfungible property and value*

But what about Margaret Radin's thesis on fungible and nonfungible property?

Radin's view was that value created a particular subset of property - nonfungible goods. But in the property theory of MB2005, value is the unifying theme for all property law.

How to enhance the value of property?

*An individual's property*

The value gained from having stable ownership when expressed through mathematical modelling shows that *retention and use* of an asset add to the owner's value, whilst *obtaining and defending* an asset detract from the owner's value.

Therefore systems in place to reduce the defense costs and transaction costs will serve to enhance the value of owning an asset.

A varied marketplace will serve to make the value of ownership optimal.

Also, by being in the habit of retaining assets owner value is enhanced. (Think Warren Buffett).

*The value for society*

Policymakers must decide whether the public creation of a society-wide property system will enhance the value to society relative to alternatives.

In determining the value to society of a property system, the value obtained by individuals can be extended to the cumulative effect on society.

A definition of property status as well as public enforcement should be provided by the state.



*in rem* rights - in the thing itself
*in personam* rights - with respect to a person
